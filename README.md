📊** Indian Agriculture Data Analysis (1966–2017)**
**📌 Project Overview**

Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy, but agricultural data is often large, complex, and fragmented. This project focuses on analyzing 50+ years of Indian agriculture data (1966–2017) to uncover trends in crop production, yield, and cultivated area across states and districts.

The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills using Python for EDA, Oracle SQL for querying, and Power BI for interactive dashboards.

**🎯 Objectives**

Analyze long-term trends in crop production and yield

Identify top-performing states and districts

Compare major crops such as rice and wheat over time

Present insights through interactive visualizations

**⚙️ Tools & Technologies**

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Cleaning & EDA)

Oracle SQL: Data storage and analytical queries

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

**📊 Key Insights**

🌾 Rice production is dominated by Punjab, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh

🌾 Wheat yield shows steady improvement in specific districts over decades

🌿 Cotton production is concentrated in five major states, with Maharashtra and Gujarat leading

🌰 Groundnut production (2017) is highest in Gujarat

🔄 Rice vs Wheat comparison highlights changing crop patterns over time

📂 Repository Structure
📁 Indian-Agriculture-Analysis
│── EDA.ipynb                     # Data cleaning & exploratory data analysis

**🧠 SQL Analysis**

The project includes 10 analytical Oracle SQL queries, such as:

Top rice-producing states

District-wise wheat yield growth

State-wise oilseed area analysis

Crop-wise production comparison over time

These queries help transform raw data into meaningful insights.

**📈 Power BI Dashboard**

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Year-wise crop production trends

State and district-level comparisons

Crop yield analysis

Interactive filters for better exploration
